[00:00.00]英语慢速听力听力 South Korea Demonstrates Air Taxi Service
[00:00.04]South Korean officials have demonstrated
[00:04.24]a local air transportation service
[00:07.84]that could be launched in Seoul as early as 2025.
[00:14.72]The recent demonstration involved the country��s
[00:18.92]urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles.
[00:22.52]The vehicles are designed to transport people
[00:27.36]between major airports and downtown Seoul.
[00:32.12]Officials say the taxi service
[00:35.88]is expected to cut travel time
[00:39.04]between the two places by about two-thirds.
[00:44.00]Last year, South Korea announced plans to launch
[00:48.76]urban air travel services by 2025.
[00:53.36]The transport ministry estimates such services
[00:59.04]would reduce travel time for distances
[01:02.96]between 30 and 50 kilometers
[01:06.44]from one hour by car to 20 minutes by air.
[01:11.84]Transport Minister Noh Hyeong-ouk
[01:16.20]attended the UAM air traffic demonstration.
[01:20.76]He said such vehicles are expected
[01:25.00]��to become one of the common means of transportation
[01:29.56]that citizens use in daily life.��
[01:33.76]Therefore, it is ��imperative�� that UAM services
[01:39.04]are tested in different environments," Noh added.
[01:44.16]During the demonstration, a pilot flew a two-seat air taxi model
[01:51.28]by Germany's Volocopter at Seoul's Gimpo Airport.
[01:56.92]The test aimed to demonstrate
[02:00.12]the vehicle��s control and coordination.
[02:04.96]The Volocopter vehicle is powered by rotors
[02:09.52]that permit it to take off and land like a helicopter does.
[02:15.16]The model demonstrated can be piloted
[02:18.92]or operate without a pilot.
[02:22.00]However, a transport ministry official
[02:25.92]said that when passengers are onboard UAMs,
[02:30.96]a pilot must also be onboard to control the vehicle.
[02:37.00]This is a safety measure for the taxi service
[02:41.00]and will also help the vehicles
[02:43.96]gain public acceptance, the official added.
[02:47.92]South Korean designers
[02:50.88]also showed off a model of another UAM vehicle.
[02:55.40]That one will not be ready for flight tests until next year.
[03:01.80]The team producing that vehicle plans to develop
[03:05.64]a five-seat version, the transport ministry said.
[03:11.04]Other technology demonstrated at the event
[03:15.28]included imaging equipment to track the aircraft,
[03:19.60]as well as lighting systems for specially designed
[03:24.76]"vertiports" where air taxis will land and take off.
[03:30.92]A trip from Incheon International Airport
[03:35.16]to central Seoul is expected to cost about $93
[03:41.08]when the service starts in 2025.
[03:45.56]That is much higher than a trip currently
[03:49.76]with the most costly taxi service.
[03:53.08]But transport ministry officials said the cost
[03:57.84]is expected to drop to about $17 per trip by 2035,
[04:05.16]if the market continues to experience strong growth.
[04:11.24]In a statement, the ministry said the test flight demonstrated
[04:16.44]the abilities of air traffic control systems.
[04:20.92]The ministry said the systems that currently manage
[04:25.44]all airport flights in the country
[04:28.24]can also manage UAM air traffic.
[04:32.68]This shows that the existing air traffic operations
[04:37.56]can be carried out ��in harmony
[04:40.28]with UAM operations," the statement said.
