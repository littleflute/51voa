[00:00.00]英语慢速听力听力 Anymore, Any Longer, No Longer
[00:01.92]Hello! This week on Ask a Teacher
[00:04.40]we answer a question from Yoo Yoo in Somalia.
[00:08.92]What are the differences between "any longer,"
[00:11.72]"anymore" and "no longer?" --Yoo Yoo, Somalia.
[00:15.64]Dear Yoo Yoo,
[00:16.96]Thank you for writing to us.
[00:19.28]These three expressions are similar.
[00:22.40]So, they may cause some misunderstandings among learners.
[00:27.20]Although the three expressions have the same meaning,
[00:30.08]you should be careful how you use them.
[00:33.52]They must be used in different kinds of statements or questions.
[00:38.48]Let us look at them more closely.
[00:40.92]“Any longer” is an adverb,
[00:43.48]that is, it gives us more information
[00:45.68]about the action in a statement or question.
[00:49.44]It means that something that was once true or possible
[00:53.44]is not now true or possible.
[00:56.88]Here is an example:
[00:59.08]Because of the coronavirus,
[01:01.52]we can’t sit close together in the movies any longer.
[01:06.92]Note that the sentence has a negative (can��t).
[01:10.20]You will only find this expression in questions or statements with a negative.
[01:16.60]Here is a question using ��any longer.��
[01:19.56]��Don��t�� is the negative.
[01:22.88]Don��t you go to that store any longer?
[01:26.96]��Anymore�� is an adverb when written as one word,
[01:30.08]meaning that something that was once true is not true.
[01:34.64]For example,
[01:36.04]Chris and Sandy are not dating anymore.
[01:41.28]When people write ��any more�� as two words,
[01:44.04]it describes an amount of something.
[01:47.56]Here is an example:
[01:49.68]Do we have any more ice cream?
[01:53.52]If you are unsure, look for the negative
[01:56.36]and for the location of ��any more�� �C is it at the end?
[02:00.72]Here is the same question with the adverb ��anymore:��
[02:06.52]Don��t we have ice cream anymore?
[02:09.92]This question has a negative, ��not��
[02:12.88]and ��anymore�� is at the end.
[02:16.24]Finally, the expression ��no longer��
[02:19.04]appears in statements or questions
[02:21.40]without other negative words.
[02:24.76]The word ��no�� is a negative already.
[02:27.40]Here is one example:
[02:30.80]I will no longer eat pizza before going to bed
[02:35.36]�C it gives me bad dreams!
[02:39.52]Note that ��no longer�� can appear in the middle of a sentence.
[02:44.28]I hope this answers your question, Yoo Yoo,
[02:46.68]so you will no longer have problems with these three expressions.
[02:51.64]What question do you have about American English?
[02:55.08]Send us an email at learningenglish@voanews.com
[03:01.36]And that��s Ask a Teacher.
[03:03.44]I��m Jill Robbins.
